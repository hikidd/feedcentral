    version: '1.5.0',
    name: 'Reliability, Ingestion Limits & Cleanup Consolidation',
    type: 'minor',
    date: 'November 11, 2025',
    changes: [
      {
        type: 'feature',
        description: 'Per-source daily ingestion limits (tier-aware)',
        details: 'To keep feeds useful and prevent overload, FeedCentral now enforces daily article limits per source based on your account tier. Free, Premium and Pro tiers have different limits; the UI shows simple indicators so you can see when a source is near its daily limit.',
      },
      {
        type: 'feature',
        description: 'Unified article cleanup endpoint',
        details: 'Background cleanup now runs from a single, consolidated endpoint that handles both system and user-added articles. This simplifies maintenance and ensures old, unbookmarked articles are cleaned up automatically while bookmarked items are preserved for you.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'Cron script compatibility and graceful deprecation',
        details: 'The scheduled cleanup script has been made tolerant of older, legacy endpoints so existing server cron jobs won\'t fail unexpectedly. The old user-article cleanup route now returns a clear deprecation response to help admins update their cron configuration safely.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'UI and translation polish',
        details: 'Various spacing fixes and new i18n keys were added to the Sources and app pages so UI elements display correctly in both English and French. Small layout tweaks improve readability across devices.',
      },
      {
        type: 'fix',
        description: 'Sanitized feed HTML to block unsafe content',
        details: 'Feed content is now sanitized server-side to remove scripts, styles and other unsafe tags. This prevents malicious feed items from running hidden code in your browser and makes article pages safer to view.',
      },
      {
        type: 'fix',
        description: 'SSRF protections for feed and image fetching',
        details: 'Added host/IP checks that block requests resolving to private or reserved network addresses unless explicitly allowed. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) is when an attacker tricks the server into requesting internal resources; these checks reduce that risk by refusing to fetch from local or private IPs.',
      },
      {
        type: 'fix',
        description: 'Tighter image allowlist and safer image handling',
        details: 'Images from unknown or potentially unsafe hosts are now removed from feed content and replaced with a clear placeholder. SVGs are blocked, large images and redirects are rejected, and non-HTTPS images are not allowed. This avoids layout breakage and prevents risky image payloads from being served directly.',
      },
      {
        type: 'fix',
        description: 'Image proxy behavior for user-provided sources',
        details: "For user-added (custom) sources the server will not proxy remote images by default — this prevents the server from fetching arbitrary third-party URLs on behalf of anonymous visitors. When proxying is disabled the UI shows a clear placeholder ('Image removed for security reasons') with an 'Open original article' link. These strings are translatable in the UI.",
      },
      {
        type: 'feature',
        description: 'Image proxy with caching and sanitization',
        details: 'A new server-side image proxy can fetch, sanitize and cache remote images. The proxy converts images to a safe format when possible, enforces size/type limits, and blocks disallowed hosts and private IPs — improving reliability and privacy when viewing article thumbnails.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'Configurable allowed feed CIDRs',
        details: 'Administrators can now configure a list of allowed IP ranges (CIDRs) for feed resolution via the environment (RSS_ALLOWED_CIDRS). This gives operators control over which internal or external networks are considered safe for feed fetching.',
      },
      {
        type: 'fix',
        description: 'Reader and image reliability improvements',
        details: 'Improved handling of article images and reader load logic so articles open reliably even when images come from many different sources. This reduces the chance of client-side errors during reading.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'Operational housekeeping and safer rollouts',
        details: 'Several internal cleanup and deployment changes were made to reduce the risk of scheduled jobs failing during rollout. These are behind-the-scenes improvements that make the service more robust without changing how you use it.',

        description: 'Massive RSS feed performance optimization - 75% faster updates',
        details: 'Significantly improved the speed of fetching articles from RSS feeds. What used to take 4 minutes now completes in under 1 minute, meaning you get fresh news faster. This was achieved through better batch processing and optimized database operations.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'Settings page UX reorganization - grouped security settings',
        details: 'Moved Two-Factor Authentication section from standalone placement after Premium License area to Account Information section, right after the Password field. All security-related settings (Name, Email, Password, 2FA) are now logically grouped together, separate from billing/premium features. Improved information architecture and user experience.',
      },
      {
        type: 'improvement',
        description: 'Added historical articles from RSS feeds',
        details: 'Populated the feed with historical articles from all sources. Successfully added 104 new articles from the past weeks, with top contributions from Bloomberg (29), Forbes (25), and Phys.org (16). Note: RSS feeds typically only provide recent content from the last 7-30 days.',
